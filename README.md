Struggles:

I struggled with animations, which I think I started on too early anyway, as I had them done before I even started doing anything related to the map or collisions that are arguably more important. 

I had some issues with the matrices I used, as I had never used anything like it before. So making collision with my character and objects in the world was a whole new challenge that took me a while to understand how to solve.

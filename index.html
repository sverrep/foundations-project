      This is a platforming game made with javascript and a tiny bit of html and css. The goal of the game is to reach the end of the map without falling off the platforms. 
      There is currently one map created with a couple of different blocks and collisions. The controls are very basic: use the arrow keys to move to 
      either side or to jump.
